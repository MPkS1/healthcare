            <h2>History of kidney failure</h2>
            <p> Ancient civilizations like the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans documented kidney diseases and attempted treatments using herbal remedies and oils.
                During the Middle Ages, kidney diseases were often associated with superstition and viewed through a religious lens, with conditions like "kidney dropsy" leading to social isolation.
                The Renaissance saw advancements in medical knowledge, but superstitions persisted, leading to treatments like bloodletting.
                The 19th century marked the emergence of nephrology as a distinct medical specialty, with significant contributions to classification and diagnosis.
                The 20th century witnessed rapid advancements in nephrological research and treatment, including the development of dialysis and kidney transplantation.
                In the contemporary era, nephrology continues to evolve with advancements in technology and targeted therapies like immunosuppressants and regenerative medicine.</p>

                Chronic Conditions: Diabetes and hypertension are leading causes of kidney failure, damaging the kidneys over time.
                Infections: Bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections can lead to kidney diseases such as glomerulonephritis or pyelonephritis.
                Autoimmune Disorders: Conditions like lupus nephritis involve the immune system attacking the kidneys, leading to inflammation and tissue damage.
                Medications: Certain medications, especially when used long-term or in high doses, can cause kidney damage.
                Kidney Stones: Formation of kidney stones can block urine flow and lead to kidney damage or infection.
                Obstructive Uropathy: Conditions like enlarged prostate or urinary tract obstructions can impair urine flow, leading to kidney damage.
                Toxins and Environmental Factors: Exposure to certain chemicals, heavy metals, or environmental pollutants can damage the kidneys.
                Trauma or Injury: Physical trauma, accidents, or surgical procedures involving the kidneys can result in kidney damage.</p>
