            <h2>History of heart stroke</h2>
            <p> Ancient civilizations like the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans documented heart strokes and attempted treatments using herbal remedies and various practices.
                During the Middle Ages, heart strokes were often associated with supernatural beliefs and viewed through a mystical lens.
                The Renaissance saw some advancements in understanding heart health, but misconceptions about strokes persisted, leading to limited treatment options.
                The 19th century marked the emergence of modern medicine's understanding of cardiovascular diseases, with significant contributions to diagnosis and management.
                The 20th century witnessed rapid advancements in cardiology research and treatment, including the development of surgical interventions and medications to prevent and treat strokes.
                In the contemporary era, cardiovascular health remains a major focus of medical research and public health efforts, with ongoing efforts to prevent and treat heart strokes.</p>
