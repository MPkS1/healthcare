            <h2>History of obesity</h2>
            <p> Obesity has been a concern throughout human history, although its prevalence has increased significantly in modern times.
                Historically, obesity was often associated with wealth and prosperity due to access to abundant food resources, while malnutrition was more common among the poor.
                In the 20th century, changes in lifestyle, diet, and physical activity patterns, along with technological advancements, contributed to the global rise in obesity rates.
                Obesity became recognized as a public health crisis, leading to efforts to raise awareness, promote healthy behaviors, and implement policies to address the underlying causes.</p>
