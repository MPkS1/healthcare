            <h2>History of Malaria</h2>
            <p> Malaria has a long history dating back thousands of years, with evidence of its impact found in ancient texts and archaeological findings. 
                Ancient civilizations like those in Egypt, Greece, and Rome documented the disease's symptoms and attempted treatments using various herbs and natural remedies.
                Throughout history, malaria has been a significant public health concern, particularly in regions with warm climates and stagnant water bodies, which are ideal breeding grounds for the mosquitoes that transmit the disease.
                The discovery of the malaria parasite by Ronald Ross in 1880 marked a significant milestone in understanding the disease's transmission and lifecycle.
                The development of antimalarial drugs like quinine and artemisinin has played a crucial role in malaria treatment and control efforts.
                Despite advances in prevention and treatment, malaria remains a major global health challenge, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where the burden of the disease is highest.</p>

            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>Causes of Malaria: <br>
                Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are transmitted to humans through the bites of infected Anopheles mosquitoes.
                There are several species of Plasmodium that can infect humans, including Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium ovale.
                Environmental factors such as stagnant water bodies, deforestation, and climate change can contribute to the proliferation of malaria-carrying mosquitoes and increase the risk of transmission.
                Poor sanitation, inadequate mosquito control measures, and lack of access to healthcare also play a role in the spread of malaria in endemic regions.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Antimalarial Medications: Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), chloroquine, mefloquine, and other antimalarial drugs are used to treat malaria infections and reduce symptoms.</li>
                        <li>Supportive Care: Intravenous fluids, antipyretics, and antiemetics may be administered to manage symptoms such as fever, dehydration, and nausea.</li>
                        <li>Preventive Measures: In endemic areas, preventive measures such as insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying, and chemoprophylaxis are recommended to reduce the risk of malaria transmission.</li>
                        <li>Vector Control: Mosquito control measures such as larval source management, environmental modifications, and community engagement help reduce mosquito populations and prevent malaria transmission.</li>
                        <li>Research and Development: Ongoing research efforts focus on developing new antimalarial drugs, vaccines, and vector control strategies to improve malaria prevention and treatment.</li>
