            <h2>History of Asthma</h2>
            <p> Ancient civilizations like the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans documented asthma and attempted treatments using herbal remedies and breathing exercises.
                During the Middle Ages, asthma was often misunderstood and associated with superstition and viewed through a religious lens.
                The Renaissance saw some advancements in understanding asthma, but misconceptions persisted, leading to ineffective treatments.
                The 19th century marked the emergence of modern understanding of asthma as a respiratory condition, with significant contributions to classification and management.
                The 20th century witnessed rapid advancements in asthma research and treatment, including the development of inhalers and bronchodilators.
                In the contemporary era, asthma continues to be a significant health issue, with ongoing research into causes, triggers, and treatment options.</p>

            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>Causes of Asthma : <br>
                Genetic Factors: Asthma can have genetic predispositions, meaning it can be inherited from one's parents. <br>
                Environmental Factors: Exposure to allergens, pollutants, irritants, and respiratory infections can trigger or worsen asthma symptoms. <br>
                Allergic Reactions: Allergies to dust mites, pet dander, pollen, mold, and certain foods can exacerbate asthma symptoms. <br>
                Respiratory Infections: Viral infections like the common cold and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can trigger asthma attacks. <br>
                Occupational Exposures: Workplace exposures to chemicals, fumes, dust, and other irritants can contribute to the development or worsening of asthma. <br>
                Tobacco Smoke: Exposure to secondhand smoke or smoking can increase the risk of developing asthma, especially in children. <br>
                Exercise: Intense physical activity or exercise can trigger asthma symptoms in some individuals, known as exercise-induced asthma. <br>
                Emotional Factors: Stress, anxiety, or strong emotions can sometimes trigger or worsen asthma symptoms, although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood.</p>
