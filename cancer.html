            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>Causes are Environmental Factors:

                Tobacco Use: Tobacco smoke contains numerous carcinogens (cancer-causing substances) that can damage DNA and increase the risk of several types of cancer, including lung, throat, mouth, and bladder cancer.
                Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation: Exposure to UV radiation from the sun or tanning beds can cause DNA damage and increase the risk of skin cancer, including melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers.</p>
