            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>Causes of Typhoid Fever: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bacterial Infection: Typhoid fever is caused by the bacterium Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S. Typhi), primarily transmitted through contaminated food and water.</li>
                    <li>Poor Sanitation: Inadequate sanitation facilities lead to fecal-oral transmission, allowing the bacterium to spread through contaminated water or food.</li>
                    <li>Contaminated Food and Water: Consumption of food or beverages contaminated with S. Typhi bacteria can result in infection.</li>
                    <li>Carrier State: Some individuals, known as carriers, may harbor the bacteria in their gallbladders or intestines without showing symptoms, serving as potential sources of transmission.</li>
                </ul>
