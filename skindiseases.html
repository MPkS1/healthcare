            <h2>History of the skin disease</h2>
            <p> Ancient civilizations like the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans documented skin diseases and attempted treatments using herbal remedies and oils.
                During the Middle Ages, skin diseases were often associated with superstition and viewed through a religious lens, with conditions like leprosy leading to social isolation.
                The Renaissance saw advancements in medical knowledge, but superstitions persisted, leading to treatments like bloodletting.
                The 19th century marked the emergence of dermatology as a distinct medical specialty, with significant contributions to classification and diagnosis.
                The 20th century witnessed rapid advancements in dermatological research and treatment, including vaccines for diseases like smallpox and the discovery of antibiotics.
                In the contemporary era, dermatology continues to evolve with advancements in technology and targeted therapies like laser treatments and biologic therapies.</p>

            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>Causes of skin diseases :
                Genetic Factors: Conditions like psoriasis, eczema, and vitiligo can have genetic predispositions, meaning they are inherited from one's parents.
                Infections: Bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections can lead to skin diseases such as acne, herpes simplex, ringworm, and scabies.
                Environmental Factors: Exposure to pollutants, irritants, allergens, and UV radiation can trigger or worsen skin conditions like contact dermatitis, photoallergic reactions, and sunburn.
                Autoimmune Disorders: Conditions like lupus, scleroderma, and dermatomyositis involve the immune system attacking healthy skin cells, leading to inflammation and tissue damage.
                Hormonal Changes: Fluctuations in hormones during puberty, pregnancy, or menopause can influence skin health and contribute to conditions like acne, melasma, and hormonal eczema.
                Allergic Reactions: Allergies to foods, medications, cosmetics, or environmental triggers can cause allergic skin reactions like contact dermatitis, hives, or angioedema.
                Trauma or Injury: Physical trauma, burns, cuts, or surgical procedures can damage the skin and increase the risk of scarring, keloids, or infections.
                Nutritional Deficiencies: Inadequate intake of essential nutrients can affect skin health, leading to conditions like dermatitis, dry skin, or pellagra.
                Stress: Psychological stress can exacerbate skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, and acne, although its direct role in causing skin diseases is still being studied.</p>
