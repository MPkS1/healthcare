            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>The primary causes of diabetes: <br>

            Type 1 Diabetes: <br>

            Autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. <br>
            Genetic predisposition combined with environmental triggers, such as viruses.
Type 2 Diabetes: <br>

Insulin resistance, where cells fail to respond to insulin properly.
Insufficient insulin production by the pancreas.
Risk factors include obesity, sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy diet, genetics, and aging. <br>
Gestational Diabetes: <br>

Hormonal changes during pregnancy leading to insulin resistance. <br>
Inadequate insulin production to meet increased demands of pregnancy. <br>
Risk factors include obesity, older maternal age, family history of diabetes, and certain ethnic backgrounds. <br>
